## <ins>Repository Overview</ins>:
- This repository aims to give a deep understanding of the fundamentals of Data Science. It is split into two main blocks: Data Analysis and Machine Learning/Deep learning. 
- Each block will be split into chapters and will be relayed via Jupyter Notebook/HTML files.
- The sole focus of these notebooks focus will be on coding (with brief mathematical summaries). 
- Additionally, the resources will be centered around "from scratch" implementations (and not relying too heavily on in-built tools). 
- Every external resource I use to aid my work will be referenced clearly.

## <ins>Data Analysis</ins>
1. Introduction to Python
2. Statements and Loops
3. Numpy (Numerical Python)
4. Pandas
5. Matplotlib and Seaborn

I recommend completing the following course which provides a thorough overview of these sections (and you can also get a free certificate!): https://jovian.ai/learn/data-analysis-with-python-zero-to-pandas

## <ins>Machine Learning/Deep Learning</ins>
1. Regression (Linear & Non Linear)
3. *k*-Nearest Neighbours
4. Naive Bayes Classifier 
5. Decision Trees and Random Forests
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. Neural Networks
8. *k*-Means Clustering
9. Principal Component Analysis
10. Graph Based Learning

## <ins>Repository Audience</ins>:
This repository is aimed to anyone with a passion/strength for computational Mathematics and an interest in Data Science. It is recommended to complete the Data Analysis section first and then move onto Machine Learning/Deep Learning however if you are just interested in the brute computational codes, then it is possible to jump into the Machine Learning/Deep Learning section. The assumption is that those taking this course already have some experience in Python! 
<br>

## <ins>Future Plans</ins>:
If this repository receives good feedback i.e. people reference and use it a lot, I will produce side-by-side tutorial videos which will provide in-depth mathematical theory behind the topics via a live online course.
