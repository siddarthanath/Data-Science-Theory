## <ins>Repository Overview</ins>:
This repository aims to give a deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The key sections that will be tackled are:
<br>
1. Linear Regression
2. Non-Linear Regression
3. Logistic Regression
4. *k*-nearest Neighbours
5. Naive Bayes Classifier 
6. Decision Trees and Random Forests
7. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
8. Neural Networks
9. *k*-means clustering
10. Principal Component Analysis
11. Graph Based Learning

Each chapter will be relayed via Jupyter Notebook/HTML files. Every external resource I use to aid my work will be referenced clearly.
<br>
The sole of these notebooks focus will be on the coding (and very little Mathematics). Additionally, the resources will be centered around "from scratch" implementation (and not relying too heavily on in-built tools). 
<br>
## <ins>Repository Audience</ins>:
This repository is aimed to anyone who has an interest in going into Data Science or has a passion for computational Mathematics. However, in order to understand the Mathematics behind each section, it is essential that one has a strong mathematical background.
<br>
## <ins>Future Plans</ins>:
If this repository receives good feedback i.e. people reference and use it a lot, I will produce side-by-side tutorial videos which will provide in-depth mathematical theory behind the topics.
