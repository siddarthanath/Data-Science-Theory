## <ins>Repository Overview</ins>:
This repository aims to give a deep understanding of machine learning and deep learning techniques. The key sections that will be tackled are:
<br>
1. Regression (Linear & Non Linear)
3. *k*-Nearest Neighbours
4. Naive Bayes Classifier 
5. Decision Trees and Random Forests
6. Support Vector Machines (SVM)
7. Neural Networks
8. *k*-Means Clustering
9. Principal Component Analysis
10. Graph Based Learning

Each chapter will be relayed via Jupyter Notebook/HTML files. Every external resource I use to aid my work will be referenced clearly.
<br>
The sole focus of these notebooks focus will be on coding (with brief mathematical backgrounds). Additionally, the resources will be centered around "from scratch" implementations (and not relying too heavily on in-built tools). 
<br>
## <ins>Repository Audience</ins>:
This repository is aimed to anyone with a passion/strength for computational Mathematics and an interest in Data Science.
<br>
## <ins>Future Plans</ins>:
If this repository receives good feedback i.e. people reference and use it a lot, I will produce side-by-side tutorial videos which will provide in-depth mathematical theory behind the topics via a live online course.
